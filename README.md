# Optimizing Player Retention though A/B Testing

## Use Case

Cookie Cats is a highly popular mobile puzzle game created by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" puzzle game where players must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and complete levels. The game also features singing cats, which adds a unique and entertaining element.

As players advance through the game, they encounter gates that require them to wait for a certain period or make an in-app purchase to continue. In this project, we will examine the results of an A/B test in which the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. Specifically, we will analyze how this change affected player retention and the number of game rounds played.


The dataset contains the result of an A/B test with a mobile game, Cookie Cats from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184).
